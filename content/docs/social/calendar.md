Create different calendar options with a wide variety of Calendar libraries.

## Full Calendar

FullCalendar is a jQuery plugin that provides a **full-sized, drag & drop** calendar. It uses AJAX to fetch events on-the-fly for each month and is easily configured to use your own feed format (an extension is provided for Google Calendar). It is visually customizable and exposes hooks for user-triggered events (like clicking or dragging an event). It is open source licensed under an MIT license.
