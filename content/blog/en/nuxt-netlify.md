We are pleased to introduce you [Nuxt Netlify](https://github.com/juliomrqz/nuxt-netlify), a new module for Nuxt.js that allows you to easily create [redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) and [header](https://www.netlify.com/docs/headers-and-basic-auth/) rules for your site deployed to Netlify.

## Getting Started

Getting started is simple, just install the module as follows:

```shell
npm install @aceforth/nuxt-netlify # or yarn add @aceforth/nuxt-netlify
```

Add `@aceforth/nuxt-netlify` to the modules section of `nuxt.config.js`:

```javascript
{
  modules: [
    '@aceforth/nuxt-netlify',
  ],
}
```

The default configuration will generate an empty `_redirects` file and a `_headers` file with some caching and security headers:

```text
# _headers

/*
  Referrer-Policy: origin
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  X-Frame-Options: DENY
  X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block

/_nuxt/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable

/sw.js
  Cache-Control: no-cache
```
