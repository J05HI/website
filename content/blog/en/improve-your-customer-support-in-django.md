Currently, there are very good tools that allow you to integrate a KnowledgeBase on your site, but sometimes you do not need as many features and a simple and powerful solution is more than enough. Unfortunately for Django, there is no tool with these requirements.

<blog-image src="blog/improve-your-customer-support-in-django-scrits.png" width="2306" height="985" alt="Scrits"></blog-image>

I created [Scrits](https://github.com/juliomrqz/scrits) because I wanted a professional and open-source solution, made with Django, that I could use internally or in the projects of some of my clients.

[Scrits](https://github.com/juliomrqz/scrits) is a simple markdown powered Knowledgebase built with Django and Angular. This tool allows giving support to users through a friendly, fast, and powerful Knowledgebase.

Scrits delivers outstanding features:

- Markdown Editing
- Clean design
- Admin Panel
- Full Responsive
- Free & Open Source
- Articles Overview & Feedback Support
- Search System.

Scrits is currently in beta but you can test it and contribute any changes on [Github](https://github.com/juliomrqz/scrits). We appreciate your comments or a new idea you can bring to the table.
