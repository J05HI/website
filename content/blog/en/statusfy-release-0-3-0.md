It was just released a [new version](https://github.com/juliomrqz/statusfy/releases/tag/v0.3.0) of Statusfy with new features and performance improvements: Docker support, new commands, three new languages translate the Interface and more.

## CLI

Two new commands are now available: [delete-incident](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/commands.html#delete-incident) and [update-incident](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/commands.html#delete-incident). They are useful if you're managing a huge amount of incidents or multiple languages.

## Scheduled Maintenance

We apply minor improvements to the layout of the Scheduled Incidents: the end date is now displayed as well as the incident content. You can also customize the [position of this section](https://docs.statusfy.co/config/#scheduled), choosing one of these options: belowSystems, aboveSystems, and aboveGlobalStatus.

## Docker

We now officially support [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/bazzite/statusfy). We don't recommend it for production yet, we need your feedback first in order to make sure that the image works properly.

## New translations:

Three new languages translate the Interface:

- German (thanks to [Dennis Herzberg](https://github.com/dennis47528))
- Hungarian (thanks to [Peter Borsa](https://github.com/asrob))
- Portuguese from Brazil (thanks to [felipeklasen](https://github.com/felipeklasen))

If you're using one of these languages, you no longer need to manually provide a translation file ðŸ¤“.
