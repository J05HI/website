I was just released a [new version](https://github.com/juliomrqz/statusfy/releases/tag/v0.2.0) of Statusfy with new big features that can improve the user experience of your Status Page System: ***Scheduled Maintenance\***, ***Notifications\***, and ***Sitemap\***.

## Scheduled Maintenance

[Scheduled Maintenances](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/incidents.html#scheduled-maintenance) definition is a way to let your users know ahead of time when your system(s) cannot handle requests due to a temporary maintenance update.

We tried to keep the definition of Scheduled Maintenance as simple as possible sharing the same parameters as regular incidents but adding two new parameters: [***scheduled\***](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/incidents.html#scheduled-maintenance) and [***duration\***](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/incidents.html#scheduled-maintenance).

## Notifications

With the new [Notifications feature](https://docs.statusfy.co/guide/notifications.html), you can keep your users notified with any Incidents update your System may have. Viewers of your Status Page can access the Choices bellow by clicking a Subscribe button.

- **Atom and RSS Feed:** These feeds include all past Incidents and Scheduled Maintenances. Your users can use Feeds Readers or tools like [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/feed) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/rss/integrations) to receive updates from these feeds.
- **iCalendar:** Your users can subscribe to a calendar containing all of your upcoming and past Scheduled Maintenances. The calendar is published using iCalendar, a popular format which is supported by most modern calendar applications.
- **Twitter:** Define Twitter accounts that your users can access in order to receive updates.
- **Support Site:** Define an external Support Site your users can access in order to receive updates from other sources you may want to provide.

***Most of these Notifications Choices are enabled by default but you can disable them in your config file. More info\*** ***[here](https://docs.statusfy.co/config/#notifications).\***

## Sitemap

Now you can notify to the search engine bots the available pages in your Status Page System with a **Sitemap**. This can help all the pages in your system to be found more easily.
